## 🌀 How It Works  

### 🗂️ ETL  
Extract Boston condo pricing, incentives, and macro data; transform into unified time series; load into ML-ready tables.  

### 📊 EDA  
Explore price distributions, incentive impacts, and seasonal patterns with interactive visualizations.  

### 🧬 Micro-Alpha Scaffolding™  
Build focused sub-models on niche signals—like fringe market incentives—layered to amplify alpha.  

### 🏗️ Feature Engineering  
Synthesize lagged mortgage rates, inflation adjustments, and neighborhood quality into predictive features.  

### 📈 Price Forecasting  
Train ensemble regressors (Random Forest, XGBoost) on log-transformed price indices.  

### 🌐 Macroeconomic Scenario Forecasting Engine™  
Simulate future housing price indices under user-defined interest-rate and inflation regimes.  

### 📊 Scenario Forecast Comparison Engine™  
Overlay historical data and multiple rate scenarios in one plot with clear seasonal markers.  

### 🎲 Macroeconomic Scenario Probability Calculator™  
Assign probabilities to each scenario based on historical patterns and market expectations.  

### ⚖️ Weighted Macroeconomic Probability Calculator™  
Compute a blended forecast by weighting scenario outputs by their assigned probabilities.  
---
### 🏙️ Incentive & Decision Modules

### 🎁Micro-Market Incentive Value Extraction Calculator™  
Quantify how local closing-cost credits, rate buydowns, and amenity packages shift effective price.  

### 🎯The Buy Signal Decision Engine™  
Apply decision logic to forecasted scenarios, generating “buy now” or “wait” signals.  

### 📆 Upgrade Path & Timeline Calculator™  
Model equity build-up and trade-up timing from studio to penthouse, under multiple appreciation rates.  

### 💸 Move-In Bonus Calculator™  
Calculate net present value of developer incentives when negotiating purchase.

## 📉 Predictive Modeling Clairvoyance Index™
## Marhc 2025 ⏭️ September 2025 Prediction Robustness Annotation 

> **📉 Pre-April 2025 "Market Tarriff Tantrum Drag", my housing interest rate forecasted in March 2025: -6.18%**  
> Alpha De Luxe™ priced in a somewhat unexpected stock market volatility event in April as a "tariff tantrum" reaction 
>  
> - My forecast looks poised to land within 0.06% of ground truth (pending final Fed rate cut confirmation, 99% probable)  
> - Some tariff finalizations are still pending, with a 90-day extension active (e.g., China)  
> -  As lightning doesn't strike twice, you can also check out my modern mercantilism dashboard which looks poised to correctly call an average 15% tarriff rate across the board.
>  
> *Predictions this robust are not mere good fortune —it’s latent signal clairvoyance.*  
>  
> 🔗 [Modern Mercantilism Dashboard](https://github.com/GarrickPinon/Modern-Mercantilism)  
> *Average tariff rate now converging toward the 15% estimate embedded in the original model.*

### 📓 Textbook vs Codebook: Strategic Modeling Edition

1. **Scenario Probability Calculation**  
   *Textbook View*: P(scenario) = Σ(weight × likelihood) across macro paths  
   *Codebook Execution*: `scenario_prob = sum(w * p for w, p in zip(weights, likelihoods))`

2. **Upgrade Timeline Estimation**  
   *Textbook View*: T_upgrade = (Δ equity + concessions) / target unit delta  
   *Codebook Execution*: `time_to_upgrade = (equity_gain + concessions) / unit_price_diff`

3. **Buy Signal Logic**  
   *Textbook View*: Signal = 1 if (NPV_future - NPV_now) > threshold  
   *Codebook Execution*: `buy_signal = int((npv_future - npv_now) > trigger_threshold)`

4. **Concession Value Extraction**  
   *Textbook View*: Value = Σ(bonus × time_saved) across upgrade path  
   *Codebook Execution*: `concession_value = sum(bonus * time_saved for bonus, time_saved in path)`
